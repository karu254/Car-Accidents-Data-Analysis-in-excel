Data: The dataset used in this analysis includes records of road traffic casualties, categorized by the severity of the incident (fatal, serious, and slight casualties).

Analysis: Several analyses are performed to gain insights into the distribution and trends of casualties:

Monthly Casualties Comparison: 
Compares the number of casualties in the current year with those of the previous year.
Casualties by Vehicle Type: Breakdown of casualties by the type of vehicle involved (e.g., cars, motorcycles, bicycles).
Casualties by Road Type: Analysis of casualties based on the type of road (e.g., highways, local roads).
Casualties by Road Surface: Examination of casualties according to the condition of the road surface (e.g., dry, wet).
Casualties by Location: Analysis by location, including urban and rural areas.
Casualties by Lighting Condition: Examination of casualties under different lighting conditions (e.g., daylight, night with street lights).
Filter Panel: An interactive filter panel is provided, allowing users to filter the data based on specific criteria:

Year
Month
Rural or Urban location
